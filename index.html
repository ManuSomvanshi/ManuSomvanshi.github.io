      <p> I am a mathematics Master's graduate from <a href="https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Mohali, India </a>. I completed my Master's thesis jointly under <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jamesfarremath/"> James Farre </a> at MPI-MIS and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/psardarmath/"> Pranab Sardar </a> at IISER-Mohali in 2025. During my undergraduate, I worked part time for <a href="https://www.luganodes.com"> Luganodes </a> to optimize their algorithm for setting "gas prices" on the <a href="https://sui.io/"> SUI </a> test-net and main-net. Contact me in case you require my CV. </p>
      <p> Here are the axioms by <a href="https://fardila.com/"> Federico Ardilla</a> which I uphold: </p>
      <ol class="axioms">
        <li enum="Axiom 1."> Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.  </li>
        <li enum="Axiom 2."> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. </li>
        <li enum="Axiom 3."> Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
        <li enum="Axiom 4."> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. </li>
      </ol>

        <h2> Research interests </h2>
        <p> I am currently interested in the study of Mapping Class groups (MCG), Big Mapping Class Groups, Infinite Type Surfaces, Teichm&uuml;ller Theory, and Hyperbolic geometry. <br>
        I have also conducted research in mathematical physics in the past. In particular, I was interested in a rigorous "quantization" process of a given physical phase space.</p>

          <h2> Some of my Notes</h2>
          <p> On my Github, you will find some (incomplete but useful) <a href="https://www.github.com/ManuSomvanshi/MathNotes"> notes  </a> on basic math courses I made as an undergraduate student along side with a class <a href="https://www.github.com/ManuSomvanshi/ConguentNumber"> project on congruent numbers and Tunnell's theorem</a>. Below are some more resources which I made for various reasons: </p>
          <ol class="lists">
            <li> Notes on <a href="res/retractible.pdf"> Retracts of Free Groups</a>. </li>
            <li> Notes on proving <a href="res/upper-half-plane.pdf"><i>SL<sub> 2 </sub>(R)/SO<sub>2</sub>(R)</i> is homeomorphic to the upper half plane</a>.</li>
            <li> A short <a href="res/ECDH.pdf"> presentation </a> on application of the theory of algebraic curves in <i> Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</i>. </li>
            <li> An <a href="res/mapping-class-group.pdf"> introduction</a> to Mapping Class Groups and the Nielson-Thurston classification theorem using the example of a Torus. I presented this to undergraduates who were majoring in mathematics. </li>
            <li> I presented <a href="res/poster.pdf"> this poster</a>, based on my thesis work, to undergraduates at IISER-Mohali.</li>
